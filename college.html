With the dawn of Independence, the need for establishing a sound technological basis for proper industrial advancement of the country was realised. Towards the fulfilment of this need, a number of Engineering Institutions were established by several State Governments. It was at this juncture that Mr.C.Rajam, with his characteristic pioneering spirit, patriotic fervor and unwavering enthusiasm came up with a munificent donation of Rs. 5 lakhs through the sale of his house and founded the MIT. Thus in July 1949, the MIT was established as an All India Technological Institution with the two-fold objectives of providing
<br>
1. Engineering education of University standard in specialised fields and<br>
2. Facilities for research in these and allied fields, free from regional limitations both in regard to its staff and students.
